# TASK DEFINITIONS FOR THE "RESEARCH AGENT" HACKATHON
# This file outlines the specific assignments for each agent in the crew.
# Placeholders: {topic} will be dynamically inserted at runtime.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Task 1: Initial Knowledge Ingestion and Summarization
# Assigned to: knowledge_ingestor
# Goal: To process the source material and create a foundational summary.
ingestion_task:
  description: >
    Process the provided research documents on the topic of {topic}.
    For each document, meticulously extract and summarize the following:
    1. The core research question or hypothesis.
    2. The key methodologies used.
    3. The primary findings and conclusions.
    Compile these summaries into a clear, consolidated brief.
  expected_output: >
    A structured summary document containing the key points (hypothesis,
    methodology, and findings) for each research paper provided. This will serve
    as the foundational context for the critical review process.
  agent: knowledge_ingestor

# Task 2: Critical Review and Question Generation
# Assigned to: research_reviewer
# Goal: To analyze the initial summary, identify weaknesses, and foster deeper reasoning.
review_task:
  description: >
    Critically analyze the research brief provided by the Knowledge Ingestor.
    Your analysis should focus on:
    - Identifying any potential contradictions or inconsistencies between the findings of different papers.
    - Questioning the underlying assumptions of the research methodologies.
    - Highlighting any logical gaps or areas where the conclusions seem unsupported.
    Your goal is to challenge the initial findings to ensure the final report is robust.
  expected_output: >
    A bullet-point list of critical questions, identified weaknesses, and potential
    areas of conflict based on your review of the research brief. This critique
    will guide the final synthesis.
  context:
    - ingestion_task # This task depends on the output of the ingestion_task
  agent: research_reviewer

# Task 3: Synthesis and Insight Generation
# Assigned to: insight_synthesizer
# Goal: To create the final "Collective Insight Report" with a new hypothesis.
synthesis_task:
  description: >
    Synthesize the initial research brief and the critical review into a final
    "Collective Insight Report" on {topic}. The report must integrate the findings
    and the critique to present a balanced view.
    The final report must include three distinct sections:
    1.  **Collective Insights:** A summary of what these papers collectively suggest about {topic}.
    2.  **A New Hypothesis:** Based on the synthesis, propose one novel, testable hypothesis for future research.
    3.  **Reasoning Trace:** Briefly explain the reasoning that led to the hypothesis, citing the source papers.
  expected_output: >
    A final, well-formatted "Collective Insight Report" in Markdown. The report must
    be clear, concise, and contain the three required sections (Collective Insights,
    New Hypothesis, and Reasoning Trace).
  agent: insight_synthesizer
  context:
    - ingestion_task
    - review_task # This task depends on the outputs of the previous two tasks
